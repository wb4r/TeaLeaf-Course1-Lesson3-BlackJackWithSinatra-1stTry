MOCKUP DESIGN - UI BASED


I have been trying to create the game from the begining until the decks are shown. I have created several get and post to arrive there but I am unable to establish a succesful IF statement in case the user chooses an amount to bet over 500$. I have tried succesfully other 'if statements' but I cant do this one. I've tried in the erb files and in main.rb file. (code on this github)


Assignment:

Somehow the UI has to have a direct connection with the http responses of the program. The user will be interacting with the app constantly. All those interactions have to have get/post code to give a response to it. 

The interactions I can think of, are those:

- enter name
- enter amount of $ to bet
- asking to 'start over'
- hit and stay options
- see dealers cards
- play again option

For each one of those actions has to be an http post because it is an interaction of the user, where something is being submitted.
